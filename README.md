## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Framingham Heart Study dataset to identify key risk factors associated with heart disease and evaluate their predictive significance.

The objective was to:
- Perform structured data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyze statistical relationships between health indicators
- Evaluate predictive potential of clinical features

This project demonstrates applied data science skills in healthcare analytics.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains patient-level clinical data including:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Smoking habits
- Diabetes status
- BMI
- Heart disease occurrence (target variable)

  ## 🔬 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Checked for data inconsistencies
- Encoded categorical variables
- Feature inspection and validation

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution analysis of numerical variables
- Correlation matrix evaluation
- Risk factor comparison across groups
- Visual trend analysis

### 3️⃣ Statistical Analysis
- Identification of significant predictors
- Relationship analysis between age, cholesterol, and blood pressure
- Interpretation of cardiovascular risk indicators

### 4️⃣ Predictive Insight Evaluation
- Feature importance interpretation
- Evaluation of risk patterns
- Model readiness preparation

## 📈 Key Findings

- Age and systolic blood pressure show strong association with heart disease risk.
- Cholesterol levels and smoking habits contribute significantly to risk patterns.
- Combined clinical indicators provide better predictive signals than individual features.
- Data preprocessing significantly improves interpretability and reliability.
